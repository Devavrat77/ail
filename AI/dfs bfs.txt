Certainly, let's go through the code line by line and explain each part:

```python
# Define an undirected graph as an adjacency list
graph = {
    'A': ['B', 'C'],
    'B': ['A', 'D', 'E'],
    'C': ['A', 'F'],
    'D': ['B'],
    'E': ['B', 'F'],
    'F': ['C', 'E']
}
```
- This part defines an undirected graph using an adjacency list. It's a Python dictionary where each key represents a node, and the corresponding value is a list of neighbors to which the node is connected. The graph includes nodes 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', and 'F' with their respective connections.

```python
#-----------------------DFS---------------------------
```
- This is a comment indicating that the code below will demonstrate Depth-First Search (DFS).

```python
def dfs(graph, node, visited):
```
- This line defines a function named `dfs`. It is a recursive function that performs a Depth-First Search on the graph. It takes three parameters:
    - `graph`: The graph represented as an adjacency list.
    - `node`: The current node to explore.
    - `visited`: A set that keeps track of visited nodes.

```python
    if node not in visited:
```
- This condition checks if the current `node` has not been visited yet.

```python
        print(node, end=' ')
```
- If the `node` has not been visited, it prints the node without moving to a new line.

```python
        visited.add(node)
```
- It adds the `node` to the `visited` set to mark it as visited.

```python
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
```
- It iterates through the neighbors of the current `node`.

```python
            dfs(graph, neighbor, visited)
```
- For each neighbor, it recursively calls the `dfs` function to explore that neighbor. This process continues until all connected nodes are visited.

```python
# Initialize a set to keep track of visited nodes
visited = set()
```
- Here, an empty set called `visited` is created to keep track of visited nodes during the DFS traversal.

```python
# Call DFS starting from the 'A' node (or any other starting node)
print("DFS Traversal:")
dfs(graph, 'A', visited)
```
- This line calls the `dfs` function with the graph, starting from node 'A', and passes the `visited` set to keep track of visited nodes. It prints "DFS Traversal:" as a header for the output.

```python
#-----------------------BFS---------------------------
```
- This is a comment indicating that the code below will demonstrate Breadth-First Search (BFS).

```python
from collections import deque
```
- This line imports the `deque` class from the `collections` module. A deque (double-ended queue) will be used to implement the queue for BFS.

```python
def bfs(graph, start):
```
- This line defines a function named `bfs`. It implements Breadth-First Search (BFS) on the graph. It takes two parameters:
    - `graph`: The graph represented as an adjacency list.
    - `start`: The node from which the BFS will begin.

```python
    visited = set()
    queue = deque([start])
```
- It initializes a set `visited` to keep track of visited nodes and a queue `queue` using a deque. The queue starts with the `start` node, and the `start` node is added to the `visited` set.

```python
    print()

    print("BFS Traversal:")
```
- These lines add a blank line and print "BFS Traversal:" as a header for the BFS output.

```python
    while queue:
```
- This initiates a loop that continues while there are nodes in the `queue`.

```python
        node = queue.popleft()
```
- It dequeues (removes and returns) the first node from the `queue` as `node`. This node is considered for exploration in the BFS.

```python
        print(node, end=' ')
```
- It prints the `node` without moving to a new line.

```python
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
```
- It iterates through the neighbors of the current `node`.

```python
            if neighbor not in visited:
```
- This condition checks if the neighbor has not been visited yet.

```python
                queue.append(neighbor)
                visited.add(neighbor)
```
- If the neighbor has not been visited, it is enqueued (added to the `queue`) for future exploration, and it is also added to the `visited` set to mark it as visited.

```python
# Call BFS starting from the 'A' node (or any other starting node)
bfs(graph, 'A')
```
- This line calls the `bfs` function with the graph, starting from node 'A'. It initiates the BFS traversal.

Overall, this code demonstrates both Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) on an undirected graph represented as an adjacency list. It prints the order in which nodes are visited during these traversal algorithms.
