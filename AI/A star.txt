This code is an implementation of the A* (A-star) algorithm for finding the shortest path between two nodes in a weighted graph. The A* algorithm combines elements of Dijkstra's algorithm and Best-First Search and is commonly used for pathfinding in various applications, such as computer games and navigation systems. Let's go through the code step by step:

1. Import the `deque` class from the `collections` module to use it later.

2. Define a `Graph` class to represent the graph and implement the A* algorithm within it. The constructor `__init__` takes an `adjacency_list` as an argument, which is a dictionary where each key represents a node, and the corresponding value is a list of tuples, each containing a neighbor node and the edge weight to that neighbor.

3. Implement the `get_neighbors` method to retrieve the neighbors of a given node `v` based on the `adjacency_list`.

4. Define a heuristic function `h(n)` that estimates the cost from node `n` to the goal node (in this case, the goal is represented by 'D'). The heuristic function is used to guide the search and make it more efficient. It's essential for the A* algorithm to be both admissible and consistent. The heuristic values for nodes 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'D' are provided.

5. Implement the `a_star_algorithm` method to perform the A* search. It takes two parameters: `start_node` (the starting node) and `stop_node` (the goal node).

6. Initialize the open list as a set containing the `start_node`, and the closed list as an empty set. The `g` dictionary will store the actual cost to reach each node from the `start_node`.

7. Set the cost to reach the `start_node` as 0 and initialize the `parents` dictionary, where the parent of each node is initially itself.

8. Start the main A* loop. This loop continues until the open list is empty.

9. Find the node `n` with the lowest combined cost `f(n)` among the nodes in the open list. `f(n)` is the sum of the actual cost `g(n)` and the estimated cost to the goal `h(n)`. This step selects the node with the lowest expected total cost.

10. If no node `n` is found (which can happen if the open list is empty), it means that there is no path to the goal, and the function prints "Path does not exist!" and returns `None`.

11. If the selected node `n` is the goal node `stop_node`, a path has been found. The function reconstructs the path by backtracking from the goal to the start using the `parents` dictionary. It then prints the path and returns it in reverse order, representing the shortest path from `start_node` to `stop_node`.

12. If `n` is not the goal node, the algorithm proceeds to expand the neighbors of `n` and update their costs and parents.

13. For each neighbor `(m, weight)` of `n`, the algorithm checks whether `m` is in the open list or the closed list. If `m` is neither, it is added to the open list, and its cost and parent are updated.

14. If `m` is already in the open list, the algorithm checks if the cost to reach `m` from the current path (through `n`) is lower than the previously calculated cost. If it is, the cost and parent of `m` are updated.

15. If `m` is in the closed list, it is removed from the closed list, and the open list is updated with the new cost and parent information.

16. Finally, the current node `n` is removed from the open list and added to the closed list, indicating that it has been fully explored.

17. If the open list becomes empty without reaching the goal, the function prints "Path does not exist!" and returns `None`.

18. Outside the loop, if a path to the goal is found, the function returns the path, and if not, it returns `None`.

19. An `adjacency_list` is defined to represent the graph structure, and an instance of the `Graph` class (`graph1`) is created with this adjacency list.

20. The A* algorithm is invoked on `graph1` with 'A' as the start node and 'D' as the goal node.

Overall, this code efficiently finds the shortest path in a graph using the A* algorithm, taking into account both the actual path cost and a heuristic estimate of the remaining cost to reach the goal.

Sure, let's go through the code line by line and explain each part:

```python
from collections import deque
```
- This line imports the `deque` class from the `collections` module. A `deque` (double-ended queue) is used later in the code for certain data storage and manipulation.

```python
class Graph:
    def __init__(self, adjacency_list):
        self.adjacency_list = adjacency_list
```
- Here, a class named `Graph` is defined. The constructor `__init__` is defined to initialize instances of this class. It takes an `adjacency_list` as a parameter, which is a data structure representing the graph's structure.

```python
    def get_neighbors(self, v):
        return self.adjacency_list[v]
```
- The `get_neighbors` method is defined within the `Graph` class. It takes a node `v` as an argument and returns the neighbors of that node by looking up the adjacency list.

```python
    def h(self, n):
        H = {
            'A': 1,
            'B': 1,
            'C': 1,
            'D': 1
        }
        return H[n]
```
- This `h` method is a heuristic function. It takes a node `n` as input and returns a heuristic value for that node. The heuristic values are provided in a dictionary `H` and are used to estimate the cost from the current node to the goal node. In this case, all heuristic values are set to 1, indicating that the heuristic is not very informative.

```python
    def a_star_algorithm(self, start_node, stop_node):
        open_list = set([start_node])
        closed_list = set([])
        g = {}
        g[start_node] = 0
        parents = {}
        parents[start_node] = start_node
```
- The `a_star_algorithm` method is where the A* search algorithm is implemented. It takes two parameters, `start_node` (the starting node) and `stop_node` (the goal node). It initializes several data structures:
  - `open_list`: A set containing the `start_node`, representing the nodes to be explored.
  - `closed_list`: An empty set that will store nodes that have already been explored.
  - `g`: A dictionary to store the actual cost to reach each node from the `start_node`.
  - `parents`: A dictionary to store the parent node for each node, which is used to reconstruct the path later.

```python
        while len(open_list) > 0:
```
- This initiates the main loop of the A* algorithm, which continues as long as there are nodes in the `open_list` to explore.

```python
            n = None
            for v in open_list:
                if n == None or g[v] + self.h(v) < g[n] + self.h(n):
                    n = v
```
- Within the loop, a variable `n` is set to `None`. Then, a loop iterates through the nodes in the `open_list` to find the node `n` with the lowest estimated total cost `f(n)`, where `f(n)` is the sum of the actual cost `g(n)` and the heuristic cost `h(n)`.

```python
            if n == None:
                print('Path does not exist!')
                return None
```
- If no node `n` is found in the open list, it means that there are no more nodes to explore, and the path to the goal does not exist. In this case, the function prints a message and returns `None`.

```python
            if n == stop_node:
                reconst_path = []
                while parents[n] != n:
                    reconst_path.append(n)
                    n = parents[n]
                reconst_path.append(start_node)
                reconst_path.reverse()
                print('Path found: {}'.format(reconst_path))
                return reconst_path
```
- If the selected node `n` is the goal node (`stop_node`), a path from the start node to the goal has been found. The code reconstructs the path by backtracking from the goal to the start using the `parents` dictionary and then prints the path. Finally, it returns the path.

```python
            for (m, weight) in self.get_neighbors(n):
                if m not in open_list and m not in closed_list:
                    open_list.add(m)
                    parents[m] = n
                    g[m] = g[n] + weight
```
- If `n` is not the goal node, the algorithm proceeds to explore the neighbors of `n`. It iterates through the neighbors and considers each neighbor `(m, weight)`:
  - If `m` is not in either the `open_list` or the `closed_list`, it means that it's a newly discovered node. The code adds it to the `open_list`, assigns `n` as its parent, and calculates its actual cost `g(m)` based on the cost to reach `n` and the weight of the edge from `n` to `m`.

```python
                else:
                    if g[m] > g[n] + weight:
                        g[m] = g[n] + weight
                        parents[m] = n
                        if m in closed_list:
                            closed_list.remove(m)
                            open_list.add(m)
```
- If `m` is already in either the `open_list` or the `closed_list`, it means that it has been encountered before. In this case, the algorithm checks if the cost to reach `m` through the current path (from `n`) is lower than the previously calculated cost. If it is, the code updates the cost, parent, and status (moving from closed to open list) of the node `m`.

```python
            open_list.remove(n)
            closed_list.add(n)
```
- After exploring all the neighbors of the node `n`, it is removed from the `open_list` and added to the `closed_list`, indicating that it has been fully explored.

```python
        print('Path does not exist!')
        return None
```
- If the open list becomes empty without reaching the goal, it means that there is no path to the goal. In this case, the function prints a message and returns `None`.

```python
adjacency_list = {
    'A': [('B', 1), ('C', 3), ('D', 7)],
    'B': [('D', 5)],
    'C': [('D', 12)]
}
```
- Here, an `adjacency_list` is defined to represent the graph structure. The graph contains nodes 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'D' with edges and their weights.

```python
graph1 = Graph(adjacency_list)
```
- An instance of the `Graph` class is created with the provided `adjacency_list`.

```python
graph1.a_star_algorithm('A', 'D')
```
- The A* algorithm is invoked on `graph1` with 'A' as the start node and 'D' as the goal node. The function call initiates the search for the shortest path from 'A' to 'D'.
