Sure, let's go through the code line by line, explaining each part:

```python
class NQueens:
```
- The code defines a class named `NQueens` to encapsulate the N-Queens problem-solving logic.

```python
    def __init__(self, n):
        self.n = n
        self.board = [-1] * n
        self.solutions = []
```
- The class constructor takes a single argument `n`, which represents the size of the chessboard (NÃ—N).
- `self.n` stores the size of the chessboard.
- `self.board` is a list that represents the chessboard, where each index corresponds to a row, and the value at that index represents the column where a queen is placed. It's initialized with -1 to indicate that no queens are placed initially.
- `self.solutions` is a list to store found solutions.

```python
    def is_safe(self, row, col):
        for i in range(row):
            if (
                self.board[i] == col
                or self.board[i] - i == col - row
                or self.board[i] + i == col + row
            ):
                return False
        return True
```
- The `is_safe` method checks whether it's safe to place a queen at a specific row and column. It examines the entire board to determine if there is a conflict (another queen threatening the current position).
- The conditions checked are:
    - `self.board[i] == col`: Checks if there is a queen in the same column as the one being considered.
    - `self.board[i] - i == col - row`: Checks if there is a queen in the diagonal from top-left to bottom-right.
    - `self.board[i] + i == col + row`: Checks if there is a queen in the diagonal from top-right to bottom-left.
- If any of these conditions are met, it returns `False`, indicating it's not safe to place a queen; otherwise, it returns `True`.

```python
    def solve(self, method="backtracking"):
        if method == "backtracking":
            self.backtrack(0)
        elif method == "branch_and_bound":
            self.branch_and_bound(0)
```
- The `solve` method initiates the solution process based on the specified method (defaulting to "backtracking"). It calls either `self.backtrack` or `self.branch_and_bound` depending on the method provided.

```python
    def backtrack(self, row):
        if row == self.n:
            self.solutions.append(list(self.board))
            return
        for col in range(self.n):
            if self.is_safe(row, col):
                self.board[row] = col
                self.backtrack(row + 1)
                self.board[row] = -1
```
- The `backtrack` method uses backtracking to solve the N-Queens problem. It recursively explores all possible queen placements row by row.
- If it reaches a complete solution (i.e., `row == self.n`), it appends the current board configuration to the `self.solutions` list.
- If it's safe to place a queen at the current row and column, it sets the board accordingly and proceeds to the next row.
- After exploring all possibilities for a row, it resets the board configuration for backtracking.

```python
    def branch_and_bound(self, row):
        if row == self.n:
            self.solutions.append(list(self.board))
            return
        for col in range(self.n):
            if self.is_safe(row, col):
                self.board[row] = col
                self.branch_and_bound(row + 1)
                self.board[row] = -1
```
- The `branch_and_bound` method is similar to `backtrack`, using the branch-and-bound approach to solve the N-Queens problem.

```python
    def print_solutions(self):
        for solution in self.solutions:
            for row in solution:
                line = ["Q" if col == row else "." for col in range(self.n)]
                print(" ".join(line))
            print()
```
- The `print_solutions` method prints all the solutions stored in the `self.solutions` list.
- For each solution, it generates a visual representation with queens as 'Q' and empty squares as '.'.

```python
# Example usage:
n = 4  # Change n to the desired board size
n_queens_backtracking = NQueens(n)
n_queens_branch_and_bound = NQueens(n)

print("Solutions using Backtracking:")
n_queens_backtracking.solve("backtracking")
n_queens_backtracking.print_solutions()

print("Solutions using Branch and Bound:")
n_queens_branch_and_bound.solve("branch_and_bound")
n_queens_branch_and_bound.print_solutions()
```
- The code provides an example of how to use the `NQueens` class. It sets the desired board size (`n`) and creates two instances of the class: one for backtracking and one for branch-and-bound.
- It then prints solutions using both methods: backtracking and branch-and-bound. It calls the `solve` method with the respective method name and prints the solutions using `print_solutions`.

Overall, this code demonstrates how to solve the N-Queens problem using both backtracking and branch-and-bound methods, and it provides a way to visualize the solutions.
