Certainly, let's go through the code line by line and explain each part:

```python
a = []
```
- This line initializes an empty list `a` which will be used to store a collection of elements.

```python
x = int(input("Enter the number of elements: "))
```
- This line prompts the user to input the number of elements they want to sort and stores it in the variable `x` as an integer.

```python
for i in range(x):
    m = int(input("Enter the elements: "))
    a.append(m)
```
- This `for` loop iterates `x` times, where `x` is the number of elements entered by the user.
- Inside the loop, it prompts the user to enter an element (`m`) and appends that element to the list `a`. This loop effectively populates the list with the elements to be sorted.

```python
print("Unsorted list: ", a)
```
- This line prints the unsorted list, displaying the elements entered by the user.

```python
def SelectionSort():
```
- This line defines a function named `SelectionSort`. The sorting logic is encapsulated within this function.

```python
    for i in range(len(a)):
```
- This `for` loop iterates through the indices of the list `a`, starting from 0 to the length of the list minus 1. It effectively represents the current position in the list to find the minimum element.

```python
        min = i
```
- The variable `min` is initialized to the current index `i`. It will keep track of the index of the minimum element in the remaining unsorted portion of the list.

```python
        for j in range(i + 1, len(a)):
```
- This nested `for` loop iterates through the indices of the list, starting from `i + 1`, effectively representing the remaining unsorted portion of the list.

```python
            if a[min] > a[j]:
```
- Inside this loop, it compares the element at index `min` (the current minimum) with the element at index `j`. If the element at index `j` is smaller, it means we've found a new minimum.

```python
                min = j
```
- If a new minimum is found, the variable `min` is updated to store the index of the new minimum.

```python
        a[i], a[min] = a[min], a[i]
```
- After the inner loop completes, it swaps the elements at index `i` and `min`. This effectively moves the minimum element to its correct position at the beginning of the sorted portion of the list.

```python
    print("Selection sorted list: ", a)
```
- After the outer loop completes (i.e., all elements have been sorted), it prints the sorted list, showing the elements in ascending order.

```python
SelectionSort()
```
- Finally, this line calls the `SelectionSort` function to execute the sorting algorithm on the input list. The sorted list is printed as a result.

In summary, this code takes a user-defined list of elements, sorts it using the selection sort algorithm, and then prints the sorted list.
